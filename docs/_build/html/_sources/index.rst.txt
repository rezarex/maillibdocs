Welcome to Dowell-Mail's documentation!
=======================================
Dowell Mail offers a reliable and user-friendly API for sending and validating emails. Our API services provide a seamless experience for sending emails from your own email ID and validating email addresses for accuracy. Whether you need to send important notifications or verify email addresses, Dowell Mail API has got you covered.

To understand the API calls and their functionality, I recommend reading the documentation. The documentation provides comprehensive information on making API requests and utilizing the available endpoints. It explains the required parameters, request methods, and response formats for each API call.

Sending Emails
==============
Once you have your API key, you can start sending emails using Dowell Mail API. Our API is designed to be simple and easy to integrate into your existing applications. With a few API calls, you can programmatically send emails, saving you time and effort.

Validating Emails
=================
In addition to sending emails, our API allows you to validate email addresses. By using the validation feature, you can check the validity of an email address before sending any messages. This ensures that your emails reach the intended recipients and helps you maintain a clean and reliable email list.
